class TestAdaptiveDispatchToEncoder(CustomTestCase):
    """Testcase: Verify --enable-adaptive-dispatch-to-encoder on Ascend NPU.

    Background
    ----------
    In VLM encoder-prefill disaggregation (EPD) mode, a language-only server
    normally forwards ALL multimodal requests to remote encoder servers.
    This creates unnecessary network overhead for single-image requests that
    the language server can handle locally.

    --enable-adaptive-dispatch-to-encoder changes the routing policy:
    - Single-image requests  --> processed locally (no encoder server needed)
    - Multi-image requests   --> dispatched to remote encoder server(s)

    The routing decision is made in tokenizer_manager._should_dispatch_to_encoder()
    by comparing total multimodal item count against SGLANG_ENCODER_DISPATCH_MIN_ITEMS
    (default = 2).

    Dependency on PR #18118
    -----------------------
    PR sgl-project/sglang#18118 fixes a bug where mm_pool was incorrectly skipped
    even when adaptive dispatch was enabled.  Without this fix the local processing
    path crashes because mm_pool is empty.

    test_single_image_processed_locally() therefore serves as a regression test
    for that bugfix: it MUST fail on a codebase without PR #18118 and MUST pass
    after the fix is applied.  This is intentional -- write the test now, merge
    the fix, then confirm the test turns green.

    Server setup
    ------------
    This test starts a language-only server WITHOUT any --encoder-urls.
    This is deliberate: if adaptive dispatch is working correctly, single-image
    requests never attempt to reach an encoder server, so the absence of encoder
    URLs is harmless.  If adaptive dispatch is NOT working, the request will try
    to reach a non-existent encoder and fail -- which is exactly what we want
    to detect.

        Assertion rationale:
        - HTTP 200 means the language server processed the image locally.
        - Any non-2xx or connection timeout means either:
            (a) the server tried to forward to a non-existent encoder (adaptive
                dispatch not working), or
            (b) mm_pool was empty and local processing crashed (bugfix not applied).
        Both (a) and (b) are genuine failures this test is designed to catch.
